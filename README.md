#Data Structures & Algorithms in Java

This repository contains my DSA practice with Java.
I’ve been learning step by step, solving problems, and committing my code here to track progress and build strong problem-solving skills 🚀.


✅ Topics Covered

🔹 Basics

Input/Output in Java
Arrays & Strings
Recursion fundamentals

🔹 Data Structures

Linked List (Singly, Doubly, Circular)
Stacks & Queues
Hashing
Trees (Binary Tree, BST, Traversals)
Graphs (DFS, BFS, adjacency list/matrix)
Heaps & Priority Queue

🔹 Algorithms

Searching (Linear, Binary Search)
Sorting (Bubble, Selection, Insertion, Merge, Quick, Heap Sort)
Recursion & Backtracking
Dynamic Programming (basic problems)
Greedy Algorithms
Graph Algorithms (Dijkstra, Floyd-Warshall, Kruskal, Prim)
